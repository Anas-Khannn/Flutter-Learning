ðŸš€ Day 6 â€“ Mastering Flutter: Top 10 Widgets for Beautiful UIs
Welcome to Day 6 of my Flutter learning journey!
Todayâ€™s focus was on understanding and applying 10 essential widgets that play a crucial role in building clean, modern, and interactive Flutter UIs. These widgets are commonly used in real-world app development to enhance layout, organization, and user interaction.

âœ… Topics & Widgets Covered
âœ… Container â€“ for basic layout, styling, padding, and margins

âœ… Expanded â€“ to make widgets expand and fill available space within Column/Row

âœ… ListTile â€“ for clean, tappable rows with text, icons, and avatars

âœ… Stack â€“ allows overlapping widgets (e.g., text on images)

âœ… SizedBox â€“ for giving fixed height/width and adding spacing

âœ… Divider â€“ to visually separate widgets

âœ… ListView.builder â€“ for creating dynamic, scrollable lists

âœ… AppBar â€“ to add an app title and actions at the top of the screen

âœ… CircleAvatar â€“ to display rounded profile pictures or initials

âœ… RichText â€“ to style parts of a string differently (e.g., bold, colored text)
