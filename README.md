# ðŸŒŸ Day 6 â€“ Mastering Flutter: Top 10 Widgets for Building Clean UIs

This repository is part of my **Mastering Flutter** series.

On **Day 6**, I explored and implemented the **10 most commonly used widgets in Flutter**, essential for building attractive, responsive, and well-structured UIs.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

âœ… Understanding layout behavior using Flutterâ€™s powerful widget system  
âœ… Combining multiple widgets to build interactive app screens  
âœ… Handling scrolling content and flexible UI structures

## âœ… Widgets Implemented

- âœ… **Container** â€“ Used for layout, styling, and positioning
- âœ… **Expanded** â€“ Makes child widgets expand to fill available space
- âœ… **ListTile** â€“ A ready-to-use row with leading/trailing widgets and tap support
- âœ… **Stack** â€“ Allows widgets to overlap (e.g., image + text overlay)
- âœ… **SizedBox** â€“ Used for spacing or fixed size widgets
- âœ… **Divider** â€“ Separates content with a visual line
- âœ… **ListView.builder** â€“ Dynamically builds scrollable content
- âœ… **AppBar** â€“ Adds a title bar with built-in styling
- âœ… **CircleAvatar** â€“ Displays circular images like profile pictures
- âœ… **RichText** â€“ Allows multiple text styles in one block of text

## âœ¨ What I Built

A minimal yet functional Flutter screen featuring:

- A **ListTile** displaying name, role, time, and profile image
- A **ListView.builder** for dynamic content rendering
- **Expanded** to handle flexible layout constraints
- Clean visual layout using **SizedBox**, **Divider**, **Stack**, and **RichText**
